# Intro to Machine Learning using Google Bigquery

> This Repository is introduction to basic machine learning using Google's Analytics Tool BIGQUERY. All the codes are written in the form of SQL queries. Below are the steps to do Machine Learning On Google Cloud

#### 1. Create a Google Cloud Account by [here](https://cloud.google.com/free) , if you donot have one. 

#### 2. Go to APIs and Services tab on the Navigation menu on the left

#### 3. Search for Google Cloud Storage and Bigquery APIs. If they are disabled, please enable them

#### 4. Go to Google Cloud Storage tab on the Navigation menu on the left and Create a Bucket

#### 5. Upload Test and Train csv files on that Storage Bucket

#### 6. Go to Google Bigquery tab on the Navigation menu on the left

#### 7. Click on the Project name visible on lower left corner

#### 8. Click on Create Dataset which is visible on the Query editor now

#### 9. Click on the dataset and click on Create table button visible on the Query editor

#### 10. Give it an approproiate name and Under 'Create Table From:' button and select Create from GCS

#### 11. Select correct csv file from the Bucket and Click on Auto Detect Schema 

#### 12. When the table is ready you will get a message. Please start using query editor for querying data
